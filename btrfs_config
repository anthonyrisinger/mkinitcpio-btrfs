# Define the default subvolume for our root filesystem.

# Define the folder containing snapshots of our root filesystem.

# Define the subvolume used for rollback operations.
#
# This subvolume is temporary and gets deleted each time a restore is
# triggered. To make it permanent create a snapshot to BTRFS_DIR_ACTIVE.

# Define if we have to do kernel rollbacks (enabled by default).
#
# In setup with a separate /boot partiton this must be enabled to prevent
# this hook from searching for the kernel on your btrfs root.
#BTRFS_ROLLBACK_KERNEL=false

# If you use a custom kernel, specify its name and location below.
#
# Currently the kernel must be part on your root volume, as we don't mount
# anything else in early boot stage.
#BTRFS_KERNEL="/boot/vmlinuz-linux"
#BTRFS_INITRD="/boot/initramfs-linux.img"

# EXPERIMENTAL: By default we reload the kernel always. Even if we do not
# rollback. But you can enable this feature if you want the kernel to be
# reloaded on version change only. It detects build number/date changes too.
#BTRFS_KVER_CHECK=true

# EXPERIMENTAL: Try to mount RAID setups, when there are devices missing.
#
# This is usualy wanted on productive setups, because btrfs supports to
# replace faulty drives online.
#
# ATTENTION: If you enable this, you need to make sure to rebalance the btrfs
# RAID after system upgrade. Otherwise kernal panic is possible by unbalanced
# libraries.
